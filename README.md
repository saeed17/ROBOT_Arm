# ROBOT_Arm
In this task, we will design circuit that provide motion to the robot arm and give proggraming feature to make the robot react with the costumers. Moreover, first circuit will contain six servo motor within three different motion. Second, we need to design circuit contain Ultrasonic sensor, bluetooth module(replace with arduino board), Servo motor(working like hand), led(instead of video).
# Techincal info
The aim of the second circuit to make the robot greeting the costumare in specific range, however costumer should be in 25cm or less range for three second then the led and the servo motor will work instead of hand and video. In addition, first arduino board will have the Ultrasonic sensor triger and echo in the digital pins, power pin to the 5 Voltage of the arduino and last pin will connected to gnd pin, the pin rx and tx will be connected to the bluetooth module or the second arduino board. On the other hand, the second arduino will contain the servo motor and led, that we designed similer circuit before so we will not go into the connection of Servo and led.
